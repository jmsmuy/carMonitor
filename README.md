# carMonitor

## Objective
The idea behind this project is to be able to read the inputs and outputs of the Motronic 1.0 (in this case 059 ECU for BMW 535i) and deliver these readings in an android tablet with a friendly interface

## Software
I include the arduino project that must be uploaded to an arduino mega as well as an android project that needs to run on an android tablet with usb otg capabilities

## Warning
This specific project needs a 059 ECU to be modded, I recommend using a sacrificial one

## TODO
I still have to create and upload the schematics needed to connect the arduino to the ecu.
1 small change for testing purposes
